## Challenges Encountered 
- Card Layout and Alignment Problems
Recipe cards appeared stacked or misaligned on the page, especially when displayed in a grid.
Solution: I used Flexbox and CSS properties like justify-content: center; and align-items: center; to align cards properly and ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes.

- Switching from venv to pipenv
the project required using pipenv shell. When I switched, I encountered path issues because the environment changed.
Solution: With help from Purvi, I verified that all files were in the correct locations and adjusted paths accordingly. After that, the project ran smoothly under pipenv.

## Future Enhancements

As a visitor/user, I want to search or filter recipes by category so I can find the type of dish I want quickly.
- Comments and Reviews
Allow users to leave comments and reviews for recipes to make the platform more interactive.

Allow users to like their favorite recipes and save them to a personal list for easy access later.
